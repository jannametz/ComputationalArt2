# ComputationalArt2
An application for discreate and procedural art and simulation. **Things marked (WIP) do not work yet.**

## Application
The UI can handle runtime theme and scale changes.

### Start
To start an instance of the app execute the following in a workspace:
```smalltalk
CAWindow create.
```

### Use
Everything lives in a single window. All buttons have tooltips.

#### Project Menue
+ Import (WIP): Imports a Project.
+ Export (WIP): Exports a Project.
+ Import Image: Imports an image from as a new canvas.
+ Export Image: Exports the current canvas to an image.

#### Viewport
The Viewport interacts with the selected tool. The user can interact with the canvas through the tools and the viewport.

#### Canvas
The canvas displays the current state. It can be manipulated by using the tools from the toolbar or by scripting. It stores 8 bpc RGB data.

#### Toolbar
There is always exactly one selected tool in the toolbar. A tool can be selected at any time by clicking on the tool icon. When changing the the tool, the tool context menu will disply the options relevant for the selected tool.

#### Tools
The tools work with the left mouse button.
+ **Move**: Drag to move the view; scroll to zoom in and out.
+ **Pen**: Draws dots in the primary color as the mouse is draged over the canvas. (Stroke Width is WIP).
+ **Line**: Draws a line from the point where the mouse is presses to the current mouse location. The current primary color is used for the color of the stroke. The line is applied to the canvas as soon as the user releases the mouse button.
+ **Rectangle**: Draw a rectangle from the point where the mouse is pressed to the current mouse location. Stroking and filling can be enabled and dissabled. Stroking will use the primary color, filling the secondary. Stroke width is WIP. The rectangle is applied to the canvas as soon as the user releases the mouse button.
+ **Circle**: Draw a circle from the point where the mouse is pressed to the current mouse location. Stroking and filling can be enabled and dissabled. Stroking will use the primary color, filling the secondary. Stroke width is WIP. The rectangle is applied to the canvas as soon as the user releases the mouse button.
+ **Flood Fill**: Replaces the color patch clicked on with primary color. All pixels in a color patch have the same color and are connected.
+ **Reset Canvas**: Sets every pixel to the primary color.

#### Color
By clicking on the primary/secondary color button, a color picker window will appear. The user can choose a color by providing it explicitly in RGB or HSV, both in (interger range 0 to 255).

We use a custom `CARGB` color class that uses RGB 0 to 255 integer values. This is to ensure color values in the image are exacly the ones specified in the color and the falues returend from the image are exact integers. The class has the following messages:
```smalltalk
CARGB black.   "(0, 0, 0)"
CARGB red.     "(255, 0, 0)"
CARGB green.   "(0, 255, 0)"
CARGB blue.    "(0, 0, 255)"
CARGB yellow.  "(255, 255, 0)"
CARGB cyan.    "(0, 255, 255)"
CARGB magenta. "(255, 0, 255)"
CARGB white.   "(255, 255, 255)"
CARGB random.  "random RGB value"
CARGB r: red g: green b: blue. "shorthand constructor."
```
The instance has the following:
```smalltalk
c := CARGB black.
c red: 0.    "Setter for red.    Clamps to [0, 255] and rounds."
c green: 0.  "Setter for green.  Clamps to [0, 255] and rounds."
c blue: 0.   "Setter for blue.   Clamps to [0, 255] and rounds."
c red.       "Getter for red in range [0, 255]."
c green.     "Getter for green in range [0, 255]."
c blue.      "Getter for blue in range [0, 255]."
```
## Scripting
The script can be executed using the start button. The user can revert to the state before the execution by pressing the reset button. This is independet of the undo/redo chain.
### The scripting API
The user operate on the `canvas` object that is know the script runtime. The canvas exposes methods to draw and get pixel values. Colors are always [0, 255] integers and points are pixel coordinates.
```smalltalk
canvas fillR:r G: g B: b.                     "Set the fill color to rgb [0, 255] integer."
canvas fillRGB: aCARGB.                       "Set the fill color the aCARGB."
canvas fillRGB.                               "Get the fill color as CARGB."

canvas rgbAt: aPoint put: aCARGB               "Set the color at the pixel aPoint to aCARGB."
canvas rgbAt: aPoint                           "Get the color at the pixel aPoint as CARGB."
canvas pixelsDo: [:x :y | "Code here."]        "Executes the block for all pixel from left to right and top to bottom."
This method allows you to iterate over each pixel on the canvas and execute a block of code for every pixel.
